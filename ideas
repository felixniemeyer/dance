- Use data created from MIDI files for training
  - Keep the specific notes and programs (general MIDI sound set) variable
    - For a start
      - kick and 
      - snare
      - (flash can be overall FFT engergy or so) 
  - x2 by using different sound fonts

- Use data from Nighthawks annotated manually for fine tuning

- In both cases: 
  - x5 by pitching up and down 2x
  - x3 by adding reverb
  - x3 by adding noise
    - white noise
    - some noise

- Cut out 10s pieces
  - sometimes combine one song with another
  - audio and kicks.txt and snare.txt
