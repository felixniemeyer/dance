#

- get any results
	- simplify model as much as possible (no dropout etc) 
	- grid train many variations 3 episodes
	- grid apply and grid view

- grid apply script

- grid view presence

#

- grid training until monday

	- D: reduce number of combinations
		- calculate the number of episodes that will be trained

	- D: variate loss function 

	- D: save and load meta params from checkpoint

	- make buffer size a meta parameter

	- D: allow provision of additional parameters (e.g. data size limitation for testing)

	- D: name for grid run
