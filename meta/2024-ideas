more diverse Data: Get kick and snare timestamps for audio files 
 => demucs + onset detection + classification


Try various architectures and training parameters automatically
 => Evolutionary approach maybe


Presentation: 

google magenta
  - use that for dataset generation
  - https://magenta.tensorflow.org/onsets-frames

consider lower sample rates
  - will do that if performance becomes an issue
  - so far: runs quite well even on cpu


I have long sequences (689) 

technical questions
  - how to choose learn rate 

AKT workstations
  - 4 GPU workstations at AKT
  - Can I have ssh access to a linux machine?
    => HPC

Regarding latency: best case would be: the neural network learns to anticipate kicks and snares

maybe not weigh the data

About fault detection in machines, thereâ€™s the so-called DCASE challenge, they always have one track about fault detection: https://dcase.community/
