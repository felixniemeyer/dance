Use google cloud (best gpu prices, are they selling spades?). 

- Use bucket storage for ML data
  - one bucket for midi files
  - one bucket for generated files
- gcfuse

avoid high gpu prices while setting up
- start with e2 instance
- attach with / upgrade to GPU later

Avoid many files: 
- store stuff in zip files without compression
- keep output files organized in a structured way: 
  - scripts take a name for the output
