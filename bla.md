 and the chop script takes a parameter how many times it slices the input audio+labels (rounds). for midi: 1, for realworls audio: 6 or so. slicing also random (different offsets) and then all the
  manipulations volume, pitch, tempo changes, augment with added noise, reverb, you can go crazy with the different filters and augmentations. maybe write that into a metafile named after the chunk so that it
   becomes possible to check or understand later what happened.
